# Project Installation Instructions

We'll be using Python, I recommend 3.7 or newer. 
To keep the home environment tidy, we'll be using a virtual environment, you can use `conda` or `virtualenv`.
These instructions use `virtualenv` (`venv`).

I am using an IDE (PyCharm) to do a lot of my handling of the virtual environment. 
I recommend this only because it is one less thing to worry about. 

## Step 1: Setting up Environment
In this step, we'll initialize our virtual environment and install required packages.
### Initializing Virtual Environment
This can be done one of two ways: 
1) Manually using `virtualenv` (or `conda`)
2) Automatically when creating a project
in your favorite IDE.

For manual set up, please refer to: https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54.
This is not only a great resource for getting started with virtual environments but also why we use them.

As for the automatic setup, this will very slightly, depending on IDE used: 
- In your IDE, select "New Project" or "New Folder" or similar wording
- Usually in this screen or the next, when you select your language, 
you will be given an option to create a virtual environment
  - For PyCharm, it is directly under Location choice.
