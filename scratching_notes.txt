Todo:
Make explanations for:
    What an API is
    How APIs work
    Flask stuff
        flask_restful
        Resource
        Api
Add connection & functionality for MongoDB example Database of ...sentences or something idk.

API tutorial: https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#full-example

change data to CSV and comment to include where a db could be plugged in.
Adding the actual db could be the next step!
This would be better to teach folks any ways.
